## 🎓 Lessons & Best Practices

### What Went Well

1. **Planning First:** Design system JSON guided implementation
2. **TypeScript Safety:** Caught errors early
3. **Accessibility Built-In:** Not an afterthought
4. **Documentation:** Comprehensive from start
5. **QA Process:** Veteran audit ensured quality

### Challenges Overcome

1. **MUI v7 Grid2:** New API learned and implemented
2. **Prop Conflicts:** Renamed variants to avoid MUI collision
3. **TypeScript Strictness:** Proper generics and index signatures
