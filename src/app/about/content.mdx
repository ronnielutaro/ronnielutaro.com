I started my journey with a passion for building cool stuff. Over the past 5+ years, I've had the chance to build tech products and help founders turn ideas into reality.

At StartHub, I’ve supported 50+ founders across 2 different countries from idea to market by running deep customer discovery loops, translating insights into features, and closing the loop with post-launch iteration. I’m also building Rocketize, a side project where I run end-to-end product cycles. The project is aimed at building a suite of intelligent tools for Marketing Teams to streamline & improve the efficiency of their operations & campaigns, while reducing Waste & maximizing Return On Ad Spend.

This Website is where I write my thoughts, learnings, reflections & stories from behind the scenes on projects I'm working on. My wish is that what I learn or discover along the way doesn't die with me. I'm a huge open source advocate and I've open-sourced the [code-base](https://github.com/ronnielutaro/ronnielutaro.com) for this website on [my GitHub Account](https://github.com/ronnielutaro/ronnielutaro.com)

My most favorite quote is: **"Always have version 1.0"** by **Joseph Brian Kasozi Musanje**, who was one of my Lecturers back at University.
