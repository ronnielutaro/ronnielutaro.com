<CaseStudySection title="The Challenge">
Meet James, a smallholder farmer in rural Kenya. Every harvest season, he faces the same problem: getting his crops from his farm to the collection hubs. Many drivers weren't using the logistics platform's mobile app, making coordination difficult and deliveries unreliable. 

Farmers like James need assurance that their fresh produce will reach buyers on time, but the low app adoption meant drivers couldn't be tracked, routes optimized, or timely deliveries guaranteed.

<Callout type="info" title="The core challenge">
How do we build a 0→1 product that works in low-tech environments while still providing the tracking and accountability that makes the business model viable?
</Callout>

<CaseStudySection title="Discovery & Insights">
I spent 3 weeks in the field conducting user interviews with 14 drivers and 30 farmers. The research revealed critical insights that shaped our entire product strategy:

- **Drivers preferred SMS and phone calls** over app notifications
- **Internet connectivity was inconsistent**, requiring offline-first solutions  
- **Trust needed to be earned gradually** through successful deliveries
- **Farmers cared more about predictability** than real-time tracking

<Callout type="insight" title="The 'Aha Moment'">
We didn't need to force-fit sophisticated technology on users who weren't ready. Instead, we could build a hybrid system—manual operations on the backend, simple mobile interfaces on the frontend, and gradually introduce more automation as trust grew.

### User Research Quote:

*"I don't need GPS tracking. I just need to know when the driver will arrive so I can have my bags ready."*

<CaseStudySection title="Strategy & Decisions">
Based on our research, I made three critical strategic decisions:

<Callout type="info" title="Decision 1: Manual-First Operations">
Rather than building complex auto-matching algorithms, we built a simple dispatch system where operations staff manually assigned drivers to routes. This let us launch in 3 weeks instead of 3 months.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Decision 2: SMS + App Hybrid">
We built a mobile app for drivers but backed it with SMS notifications and phone call support. This redundancy ensured reliability even when internet was down.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Decision 3: Progressive Verification">
Instead of requiring GPS upfront, we used a progressive verification model: base info to start, then gradual verification as they completed more deliveries.
</Callout>
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudySection title="Results & Impact">
Three months post-launch, the numbers told a compelling story:

    { value: "65%", label: "Driver Adoption", sublabel: "Up from 25% baseline", color: "green" },
    { value: "20%", label: "Faster Operations", sublabel: "Average delivery time", color: "blue" },
    { value: "40%", label: "Usability Improvement", sublabel: "Loading time gains", color: "amber" }
  ]}
/>

### Business Impact:
- **Unlocked 3+ active drivers** in first 3 months
- **Streamlined dispatch operations** by 60%
- **Reduced coordination overhead** for operations team

*Fresh produce supply chain became 30% more reliable and predictable for farmers*
