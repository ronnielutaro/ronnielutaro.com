Alright, can you now write an issue and push it to my GitHub via mcp, for setting up the posthog and for building and implementing the hybrid approach?  I want you to work like expert veterans of an engineer + product manager with over 30+ years of experience in their prime following industry standards & best practices, you can suggest and do what's necessary, if you can break them down into smaller issues that are easily implementable by one person incrementally, and also, make it clear what's the actual success criteria/acceptance criteria to mark that as complete, what would be the actual user outcome and value proposition (business value) of what's being built. Don't be too wordy, just simple and understandable in plain English.
