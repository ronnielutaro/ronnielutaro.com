Thank you! now as a team of 30+ year veteran engineers & experts in their prime following industry standards & best practices. Can you now help write commit messages. Make commits for current changes made to codebase. I prefer small commits that are easy to review following conventional commits https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/.
