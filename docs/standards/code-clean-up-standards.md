Another thing I've noticed is that there's different scripts sprinkeled allover the place, in this code base, it's a little bit of a mess, and I'd want us to do some housekeeping, that means removing scripts that are not needed at this stage of the codebase, and also those that we need, let's organize them in proper folders, etc. let's do proper organizing and declutter. And put those that need to be grouped together grouped, etc. so the goal is that we have a cleaner codebase and remove all stale code files or scripts or MD files. etc can you help me achieve this? from a lens of veteran engineers? with 30+ years of experience? by also following industry standards and best practices of how engineers at Microsoft or Google might have approached this ?
